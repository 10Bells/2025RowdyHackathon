# Windows Event Log SIEM using Splunk

## Overview
A lightweight SIEM solution built on Splunk Enterprise to detect failed logins, brute-force attempts, and suspicious authentication patterns.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of Windows Security logs
- Custom Splunk alerts for brute-force and suspicious logins
- Dashboard visualizations for security events

## How it works
1. Splunk collects local Windows Security Event Logs (EventCode 4624, 4625)
2. SPL queries detect patterns (failedâ†’success logins, excessive failures)
3. Alerts trigger notifications and event logging
